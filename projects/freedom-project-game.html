            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>The SEP11 Freedom Project is a year long project which required us to develop a game or website of our choice using a tool of our choice. For this freedom project it was different from the previous year as I decided to make a game using Kaboom Js. This year I also worked by myself on this project without a partner. For this project I used a combination of Javascript, Functions, Loops, Arrays, and Kaboom Js. </p>

            <h3>Process</h3>

            <p>In the Beginning of the year we started off with the basic introduction of javascript and choosing our tool that we will use (game, website, etc). After we chose our tool we did not immediately go into coding and making whatever we were going to make. We first started tinkering with our tool and getting familiar with the Javascript concepts. Then we jumped more in depth into the more complex Javascript functions, arrays, loops, objects, p5js, and many more. After all of that tinkering and learning we began to work on our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and Later our BEYOND MVP.</p>

            <p>At first I chose Kaboom Js as a tool because I wanted to make a 2D game but then later on into the year I wanted to make a even more complex 2D game with Phaser 3. So I changed my tool to Phaser but procrasination was my biggest obstacle because it prevented me from managing my time and actually learning my tool. I had to switch back to Kaboom Js last minute because it was a easier tool to learn with it's playground tutorials. For the most part, this was a very fun and interesting project that was full of self discovery, creativity, exploration, and transcendance.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>

            <p>For this project I struggled to problem solve and find mistakes in my code. For instance, some of my sprites (characters) were significantly smaller than my other sprites in which I have to individually scale. I struggled to find how to scale them individually but my peers Kyle and Joe helped me out a lot by guiding me through the steps to find a solution. Often times I also find my code not being able to work even though the code that I wrote was perfectly fine but most of the time the problem was that I was missing a comma or punctuation in my code. However this was an easy fix and the Console helped me locate exactly where the problem is and helped me troubleshoot quickly. Overall, there were many challenges in these projects but no challenge was impossible to overcome.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>

            <p>Throughout this project I had many Takeaways:</p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Through this Freedom project I really feel like I've had a significant breakthrough with my public speaking skills as both my presentation in class and at the expo went surprisingly well. I feel like I am now better at presenting in front of a bigger crowd and the way I found that out was by practicing what I was gonna present. That gave me confidence when I was presenting as my mind was clear on what points I wanted to make and how I want to introduce these points to lead into the next points in my presentation. However, I do see a grow and another breakthrough I can achieve because towards the end of my presentation I struggled to grasp my audience attention with the takeaways and conclusion. I want to be able to have a more detailed explanation for my takeaways and ending of my presentation. But Overall this was a great breakthrough for me and it meant a lot.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, managing my own time for the SEP11 Freedom Project was crucial because I had to make sure that I had enough time to finish my work for other classes and at the same time have time to tinker with my tool. Throughout this project I really struggled with time management as procrasination was my biggest obstacle which prevented me from efficiently using my time to do what I wanted to do. I would be like "I will start this assignment at 10 am and Complete it by 1 pm" but this was never the case as I use excuses like "5 more mins won't hurt". These 5 more mins build up overtime and the workload eventually becomes overwhelming. But at the end this really pushed me to develop this skill of managing time although it took a lot of discipline.</li>

                </ul>
            </p>







            <h3> Self-Reflections </h3>
            <p>Overall, this project was something we had worked for the whole year and it has come to an end. I am very proud of what I was able to achieve and how much I've grown and learned throughout the year under the teaching of Mr. Mueller. This Freedom Project not only signifies my work but also what we learned. Here I wanna say Thank You to Mr. Mueller for everything he has done for us to help us grow and learn as students.</p>
