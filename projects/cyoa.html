            <h2>Wednesday, February 7, 2024</h2>
            <h4>Context</h4>
            <p>The goal of this project was to make our own adventure on the topic that we were assigned. For this CYOA project, I collaborated with my partner, Nayer, to create an adventure by using file paths. Users are able to choose their own adventure and select the paths they desire at different stages of life. This projected involved using markdown and html(It was optional). This was a fun project that allow us to practice collaboration with our partners and practice more coding or markdown.</p>
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p> For this Choose Your Own Adventure(CYOA) project we were assigned "The Game Of Life". I started off by making a repository for the project on github and added by partner as a collaborater so he is able to make changes to the repo. Me and my partner began planning by making a visual diagram using google drawings to sketch out our ideas and finalize what files we should create.</p>
         <h5>Expectations</h5>
           <p> For this project we were expected to have a CYOA plan, clear file path, minimum of 10 markdwon files, and collaboration with our partner.</p>

            <p>The Game of Life starts off with the alarming ringing to signify the start of life and they will be able to choose their own path to life. When someone chooses the wrong path or option they will be Bankrupt and life will restart. But if they choose the right path and work hard they will be able to become a millionaire and retire at a young age. Our project focuses on all the right and wrong choices that can put someone high up to the sky or drop them down to the core of the world. There were multiple internal links that brought them to a different file everytime they click on a desired choice. This was a great opportunity to work on collaborating with others.</p>

            <h3>Internal and External links</h3>
            <p>Internal links are links that bring users to other files within the repo. External links are the opposite of internal links. External links bring users outside of the repo to somewhere else like websites etc.</p>

            <h3>Challenges while making the CYOA Project</h3>
            <p>For this project collaboration was a big challenge because I never worked with Nayer before and we never collaborated. We were limited to 2-3 days of working + planning. Nayer wasn't here on the first day of the project which was our planning day. I had to text him through slack and we had a hard time deciding our plan and what we were gonna do for this project. On the second and third day we had troubles with merging and git pull/push. One mistake we made was not reading what git was sending back to us. We couldn't find the reason why I couldn't push because we didn't know that there was a merge conflict after I pulled. After we came back from break/regents week the project was thrown to the back of our heads and we had to start collaborating again. Another challenge we had was with links because at first we didn't know how to link these files together. We had to first cd into a directory to then go into the file which took us a while to figure out. This project allowed me to practice more on collaboration and Internal/External linking. Me and my partner both benefitted a lot from doing this project while also having fun.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
           <p> We were able to get a lot of practice in while enjoying what we were doing. Me and my partner learned how to do internal and external linking. I no long feel as unease when working with someone that I don't know. This project should be done more often to help students feel more comfortable collaborating and have fun while practicing.</p>
