            <h2> Wednesday, November 8, 2023</h2>
            <p>In this project the goal was to make a movie webpage about a non-existing movie with a partner. The webpage acts like a commercial AD for the movie to make people wanna watch it.</p>
            <p>For our movie webpage we decided to make a movie called Candy Thief which was about a man taking candy away from kids that put diseases in those candies. This webpage had a gradient black and orange color to match the theme of this movie webpage.
To do all of that me and my partner used a lot of html and css. For the HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) portion, there should be headings, paragraphs, div(s), span(s), customized Google fonts, inputs, and a submit button.
On the CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) portion, background color, margin, padding, border, CSS selectors: element/class/id, and 2 local images(must be downloaded)(credits to Xin yan).
  </p>
<h3>Challenges while making the Movie Webpage</h3>
<p>Challenges me and my partner faced was the planning part because we took a long time on deciding what our Movie Webpage should be about. We also had a hard time planning what parts me and my partner will do.
Stuff like divs, spans, inputs and submit we both didn't know how to do but somebody had to do it so we decided that we can both work on it so we can learn from it.
Another challenge we had was finding images that fits our webpage the best. We looked all over the place until we finally found 2 images that was funny and spooky at the same time.
This project allowed me and my partner to use what we learned so far and make something out of it which we also processed a lot of stuff throughout this project.</p>
<h3>Takeaways</h3>
<p>I learned the importance of collaborating with my partner either inside or outside of school. We used slack to text and call to work on the movie webpage.
Using resources around me was also a big take away because I used w3schools.com to learn how to make a gradient background which we can add to our MVP.
Managing out time in class was also very important because we only had 48 minutes of class that we can work together irl(in real life). Throughout this project I understood more about html and css.</p>
