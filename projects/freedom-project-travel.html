            <h1 class="margin text-center"> Freedom Project - Travel! </h1>
            <h2>Wednesday, February 7, 2024</h2>

            <p> The Freedom Project is a year-long project that required us to conduct research and develop a website on a topic of our choice. For this Freedom Project I worked alongside Joe, my peer. We chose the topic travel as we both had a really big passion for travel. Traveling has been hard ever since the pendemic in 2020. So we figured that this was a topic that we wanted to research about and make a website about. We used a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Animated.css to construct a website regarding travel. Me and Joe both used different tools. Joe used A-frame while I used Animated.css. In this way, Joe was able to make 3d models of future designs/inventions that we had in mind and I was able to make our website more engaging with animations and transitions.</p>

            <h3> Process </h4>
            <p>
                The coding portion was first held behind as we had to research our topic throughout the year. I researched hardware and software technologies that were relevant for traveling. However, I examined unpopular resorts to educate my audience about underdog tools that could impact and influence their lives. Joe repeated the same process. When we concluded our searching process, developing a prototype became the main priority. Joe and I developed several wireframes and ideas to demonstrate the overall looks of the webpage. We developed wireframes for small screens like phones and big screens like monitors so we can have a layout/plan of how we can do the responsive design of our webpage.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the most part, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS laid the foundation of my collaborative webpage. My peer and I both utilized Bootstrap cards, a vital component, to display most of our information, which also includes links and images and HTML div elements to organize our codes. To improve our website aesthetics and designs, CSS played a big role. We used various media queries along with properties to make our page responsive and stand out. We used Animate.css make the webpage more engaging and fun for users as different animations appear when the load the website and scroll through it. Moreover, A-Frame was primarily applied to show our ideas (models) of future inventions, one particularly being a highly advanced portable charger and another being a highly advanced vehicle. During this process we followed a format to develop a minimal viable product (a system that works at the bare minimum, MVP) before improving certain features later on. Which we can BEYOND MVP.
            </p>

            <p>
                After developing a webpage, Joe and I had to deliver our message. We created presentation slides and showed various peers our webpage.
            </p>

            <h3> Challenges </h3>

            <p>Incorporating many tools into one webpage can lead to difficulties. Especially for A-Frame, creating a model was not as pleasant. As an alternative, Joe used Blender to sculpt a model and further downloaded the files and uploaded it into A-Frame. This was more hefty since Joe also had to learn the basic concepts of Blender before developing a representation of my idea. On the other hand, I had to learn the Animated.css. I spent various hours to learn how to apply various animations  into the webpage as well as developing the outcome.</p>

            <h3> Takeaways </h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Creativity is an important skill to hold. The Freedom Project is based on our imagination. To develop a good-quality webpage, my peer and I had to first visualize our plans before learning such tools to make it become a reality. We has to be creative with the layout, color schemes, and overall design of our website to make it unique and stand out from other websites.</li>

                    <li>Effective research is essential when it comes to building a webpage. Joe and I had to find valuable content to display to our audiences, and by doing so, we needed an efficient way to gather information. One way we did this was instead of spending long amounts of time on a single source, both of us frequently moved to different links. Once we found desirable information, we jotted it down in our notes. This saved a surplus amount of time.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3> Self-Reflections </h3>
            <p>Overall, this project was something we had worked for the whole year and it has come to an end. Me and Joe are both very proud of ourselves for how much we had grown and learned throughout the year under the teaching of Mr. Mueller. This Freedom Project not only signifies our work but also what we learned. Here I wanna say Thank You to Mr. Mueller for everything he has done for us to help us grow and learn as students.</p>
